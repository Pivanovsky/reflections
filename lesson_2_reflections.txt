== What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new repository is created. We need it to start tracking our files.

== How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
== What value do you think it offers?

It stands between two as a buffer zone. It contains only files added to, when working 
directory contains all the files physically and repository contains all the commits 
and other git artefacts.
