== When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would rather use a remote repository for the most interesting projects which will form
my portfolio.

== Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
== automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want to control this process and pull only verified up to date changes.

== Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
== When would you use one instead of another?

Fork - is a clone of another repo done on github, it is a github feature,
is used to clone repos of other github users.
Clone - you can clone any remote or local repo to have you own version,
is used to create your own copy of any repo.
Branch - new context for the thing I work under, 
is used to save master unbroken and verified, to have posibility to do experiments.

== What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
== stored locally?

We can track our changes compairing with origin/master.

== How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
== and what would be harder?

We will notify each other what part of code we work under at the moment to avoid
collisions. It would be harder to work under the same file simulteniously.

== When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly 
== in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When I want to experiment, when I want to start working under new feature, every 
time I want to change something, but I do not want to break the master branch.
My master is in work condition. I can work under the feature and use vcs for that.
